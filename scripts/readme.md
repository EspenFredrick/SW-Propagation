# Computational scripts for processing data
The following scripts in this folder process data to get it into usable formats and create [../metadata](metadata) outputs. Descriptions of the files are listed below:
1) Correlation Calculator.ipynb : Old notebook to calculate correlation coefficients
2) ARTEMIS correlation.ipynb : Calculates FGM data for one satellite vs. ARTEMIS. ESA data (velocity, n, T) not working yet.
3) ARTEMIS correlation (pandas).ipynb : Calculates FGM and ESA data for two satellites, (OMNI/THEMIS) vs. (THEMIS/ARTEMIS). Also outputs delay times between observations and average values of parameters during the interval.
